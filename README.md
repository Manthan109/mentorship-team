# Node.js Mentorship Program

Node.js has provided opportunities to N number of developers, and it has provided me with opportunities too. With this mentorship program, I want to give back to the Node.js community in the best way possible as a thank you for existing. With this opportunity, I will contribute to Node.js and squash some bugs on the way to become a better developer and get to learn a lot from my mentors. I am always up for learning new things!
